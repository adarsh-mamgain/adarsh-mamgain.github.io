      <h2>THE JOURNEY BEGINS</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>About me:</strong> Hi I am ‘MANGYA’ (my friends call me), I am
        just a 17 year old boy dreaming to be the first entrepreneur in my
        family. I had always thought of creating a website where I can post
        something. This is my first website and I have to work on a lot of
        things but we will complete it step by step. Computers is what I love
        the most, I have some fair ideas about PC builds, programming languages
        and video editing. Do you also love computers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MY AIM:</strong> I want to share precise updates about the tech
        world. This would include PCs, gaming, networking, auto-cars and many
        more… My dream is to help my tech community by providing all the
        resources needed regarding computers under ONE DOMAIN. I think of
        listing all the questions and give them with the correct solutions. I
        also want to be featured on the top magazines about my entrepreneur
        journey. Let us make it to the entrepreneur of the year 20 _ _.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ABOUT COMMUNITY:</strong> We are planning to be the best
        blogging site for the entrepreneurs. We collectively want to post the
        things that readers would benefit – articles, software, products… You
        can share your ideas here on this website on your dedicated page created
        by me. If you want the same you can contact me on Instagram or E-mail
        me. The links are provided in the contact menu. As of now I will be
        uploading your ideas myself but will make it public in the future. There
        is no fees unless you want to promote or sell your products.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Website Update:</strong> Hi, welcome back it has been a while
        from my first blog, thought of telling you about the work completed in
        one month. I was busy with my final year exams and was not able to put
        much content. Throughout this first month, I have published some basic
        pages you can have a look – Blog, Your Page, Contact and T&C. There are
        many more upcoming pages subscribe to receive it at earliest.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am working to make this website helpful for every reader to get the
        particular information. I had added a section called ‘Your Page’ where
        readers can share their creations. If you also want to showcase your
        creation then send me your work here. I’ll be uploading more relative
        content about computer science in my upcoming blogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Work in progress:</strong> I am working on upcoming ideas and
        pages to provide better content on my website. There are eight pages
        that I have to publish within 12 weeks. It means that for every page I
        have around ten days. It might seem nothing but trust me it is way more
        time-consuming. I am writing, editing and posting whole content by
        myself which consumes a lot of time finishing the pages. I will be
        publishing some pages in the next month.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future updates:</strong> I am planning to post one blog every
        Wednesday. Subscribe to get the notifications as soon as I post
        something new. There will also be weekly news at the weekend on Sunday.
        You can sum up all the news in the easiest way possible. The news would
        cover all the International as well as National evolution in the
        tech-world in a block format. The upcoming events will also be mentioned
        in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Feedback:</strong> If you have any ideas about this blog or
        website, please do help us by leaving a comment. You can also E-mail or
        message me on Instagram.
